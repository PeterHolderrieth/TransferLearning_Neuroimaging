Create feature matrices: RUNNING - if that is finished, we have a variety of datasets for visualization which
we can use for plotting. Note that all visualizations are based on models pre-trained on the UKB.

Next steps after has been done: repeat the same thing for models fine-tuned on OASIS. Show that 
features adopt to the task.
