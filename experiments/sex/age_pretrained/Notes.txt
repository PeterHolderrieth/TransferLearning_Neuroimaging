A,B: 
- Test accuracy goes up to 0.80 which is quite high but validation accuracy is at 0.56
- I am not sure whether it has actually converged. Potentially training longer? Since we 
change tasks we might need more epochs to train than same-task transfer.
- Moreover, the huge gap in performance between training and validation data seems 
to indicate overfitting.


C: test accuracy goes up to 0.85 and increase in validation accuracy to 0.68
-increase the number of epochs to train the model

D: test accuracy 0.98 and validation accuracy 0.82
- Increase regularization effect: increas weight decay compared to A.
- Avoid pre-training of final layer. That seems to be detrimental. Features might not be useful.

E:
- compare with D with pre-training of final layer
-

F:
- increase regularization of D
