A: 2.93 (Han)

C: 2.9 (trained longer)
D: 3.3 (MAE loss! Detrimental!)
E: 2.91 (same as A)
F: 2.93 (train longer)
G: 2.91 (overfitted but went worse, changing schedule parameters)
H: 2.91 ()
I: 2.91 (higher weight decay, less epochs, maybe try out with more)
J: 2.91 (higher gamma)
K: 2.89 (small batch size)
