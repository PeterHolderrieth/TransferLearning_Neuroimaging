Elastic: done with final experiments
Scratch: done with final experiments. We got really good results (better thant the transfer learning part. Explain that somehow!)
Init with scaling (run with the same parameters as scratch. Want to see whether that gives improvements or not.): done

Age-pretrained: RUNNING final experiments


Stopped experiments:
Ft_final_three_layers: not really good results. ignored for now.
Direct transfer: We are not doing that experiment because I think it is unfair comparison because of large disjoint portions of age intervals.
