Elastic: done with final experiments
Scratch: done with final experiments. We got really good results (better thant the transfer learning part.)

Age-pretrained: RUNNING final optimization experiments.We do not really get better results than training from scratch....
Problematic....
Ft_final_three_layers: RUNNING first experiments.
Direct transfer: We are not doing that experiment because I think it is unfair comparison because of large disjoint portions of age intervals.
