ABIDE - SEX - EXPERIMENTS:
Decision: we train, validate, and test on the balanced data set.

1. Direct transfer: RUNNING final experiments.

2. Elastic: Parameters are optimized.

3. Scratch: RUN NEW EXPERIMENTS FURTHER OPTIMIZING PARAMETERS!

4. Sex pre-trained: basically but further optimization might be good.
