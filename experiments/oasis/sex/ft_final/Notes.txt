Exp1: 90% accuracy - it is not really training?! Although we have a high learning rate?! Or because we have a high learning rate?
Exp2: same as Exp1 
Exp3: same (although small lr=0.01)
Exp4: same 

How to tackle this problem? Direct transfer is so good! So we need to think about how we can improve validation accuracy!
