BALANCED RESULTS: WE RUN EVERYTHING AGAIN WITH THE BALANCED DATA!



UNBALANCED RESULTS::
------------------------
Scratch, direct transfer, elastic, sex-pretrained: done 

Ft-final sex, ft-final age: RUNNING final

Vary train size: To do


- THINK ABOUT HAVING AN OPTIMAL PROCEDURE WHICH GOES 
MODEL.EVAL() + ONLY TRAINING FINAL LAYER (I.E.ALLOW THE MODEL TO BE TRAINED WITHOUT UPDATING BATCHNORM)

- WE CHANGED THE CODE SUCH THAT THE FINAL LAYER IS NOT REINITIALIZED WHEN IT HAS THE SAME SHAPE.
WE TESTED IT WITH ft_final/exp_2_* and --/exp_2_*
