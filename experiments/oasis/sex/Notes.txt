Scratch, direct transfer, elastic: done 

Sex-pretrained: almost done (running final two experiments). Then run finals!

Ft-final sex: Optimizing hyperparameters (although not absolutely necessary to include. For consistency, it 
would still be good to get it.)

Vary train size: WAITING for results of sex_pretrained to get hyperparameters which can be used.


- THINK ABOUT HAVING AN OPTIMAL PROCEDURE WHICH GOES 
MODEL.EVAL() + ONLY TRAINING FINAL LAYER (I.E.ALLOW THE MODEL TO BE TRAINED WITHOUT UPDATING BATCHNORM)

- WE CHANGED THE CODE SUCH THAT THE FINAL LAYER IS NOT REINITIALIZED WHEN IT HAS THE SAME SHAPE.
WE TESTED IT WITH ft_final/exp_2_* and --/exp_2_*
