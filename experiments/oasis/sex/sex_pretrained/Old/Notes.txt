A,B:
achieved 97% accuracy on the validation set! Pretty good, I would say!
Train accuracy is almost constantly at 1. Maybe we need to regularize a bit more? Increase 
dropout-rate? Or increase weight decay? 

C: accuracy 98.5%
- regularization seems to bring a performance boost
- Next step: maybe increase regularization even more, e.g. with weight decay or dropout rate?

D: accuracy 97.7% 
- regularization seems to bring less of a performance boost here 
- Next step: regularize in a different way

E: accuracy 98.8%
-regularize even more (increase weight decay, increase momentum)

F: accuracy 99.6 %
-increase gamma, increase learning rate, increase patience, increase number of epochs.
