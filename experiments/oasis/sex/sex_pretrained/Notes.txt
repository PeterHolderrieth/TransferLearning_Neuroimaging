Higher wdec: 95% - not a big change
Increasing dropout: 96% - okay, improvement
Lr small: 80% (bad)
Lr zero: very bad results. BUG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! FIX IT!!!!!! WHAT IS WRONG HERE???? IS THAT BATCH NORMALIZATION PARAMETERS
ARE CONSTANTLY UPDATED????? RUN AGAIN AND SEE IF PARAMETERS CHANGE!
Increasing droupout even more: 97.7% validation accurac!
We tested now what happens if we just set model.eval() at the start (see other folder).
