Note: age_pretrained uses run 4 while ft_final uses run 0. It seems
that run 0 gives much better results from the start. We should think about
re-running experiments age_pretrained with run 0

Elastic: done
Age-pretrained, elastic,  scratch: running final experiments
ft_final,ft_final_from_sex,sex-pretrained: optimizing hyperparameters
Direct transfer: still to run for test set.
