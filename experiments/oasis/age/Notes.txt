ft_final, ft_final_from_sex, elastic,scratch, direct_transfer: done
Age-pretrained, Sex-pretrained: still optimizing hyperparameters.
Init with scaling: wait for optimal parameters for age_pretrained (we want to run it with the same parameters)
 
Generally speaking, it will be very interesting to study the effects of re-training the final layer vs 
re-training final layer + re-training full model.
