A: 4.65 MAE
B: 4.99 MAE (it overfitted, increase regularization)

Both times, we observe a slighlty quicker convergence compared to standard 
random initialization. Generally, it would interesting to consider that for two completely
unrelated task and to do re-training always with renormalization.

Running C, D, and E:
