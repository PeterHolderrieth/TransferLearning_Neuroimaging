Split January 19 2021:
Number of training examples:  187 subjects | 355 sessions 
Number of validation examples:  50 subjects | 91 sessions 
Number of test0 examples:  343 subjects | 686 sessions
Number of test1 examples:  343 subjects | 498 sessions 
--------------------------------------------------------



For training, validation and test0 we used all sessions of subjects.
For test1, we only used one session per subject I guess? 343 is the number of subjects.
The number of sessions in test1 is 498.

Adding up gives:
355+91+686+498=1630
The selection process results in 1036 eligible subjects 
and 1806 eligible sessions for the subsequent sampling process

OASIS-3 dataset
OASIS-3 contains 1098 subjects and 2168 longitudinal MRI scanning sessions.
Following LaMontagne et al.,41 the healthy control group consists of the subjects
 who have CDR score 0 from all clinical visits during the longitudinal studies. The 
 dementia group consist of the subjects who receive at least one CDR score that is
  larger or equal than 0.5 (which means we do not consider the subtypes of dementia).
   We applied quality control strictly following both of the two criterions: 
(1) Only the 3T MRI sessions with valid clinical visit (within one year since
    or before the MRI scan) are included. This was because OASIS-3 contains both 1.5T and 3T MRI scans, 
    while the CNN models were pretrained in UK Biobank scans using only 3T MRI.  
(2) For the dementia group, every MRI session used in the study should be accompanied
    with a CDR score that is larger or equal than 0.5. 
    (2.a) If a subject has multiple visits,
    we select only one MRI session that is accompanied the largest CDR score for the subject. 
    (2.b) If a subject has multiple visits receiving the same largest CDR score,  we select the
     first one among all these visits. 
     (2.c) If a subject only receives one CDR score that is larger or equal than 0.5 during the 
     clinical visits, and that visit is not accompanied with any 3T MRI session (within one year 
     since or before the clinical visit), then the subject is excluded. 

The selection process results in 1036 eligible subjects and 1806 eligible sessions for
the subsequent sampling process.

For the training/validation set, we randomly selected 187/50 subjects and used all 
the 355/91 sessions from those subjects. The rest of the subjects are therefore 
strictly untouched and forms a test/discovery set. For the HC group, if a subject
receives multiple visits, we randomly sample one visit. Together with the criterion 
(2), every subject in both HC and dementia group has only one matched MRI session, 
and there are 343 subjects within each group. [NOTE: that means you will find ]

We then sample the same number of subjects from the HC and dementia group. Within each 
5-year interval, we sample the same number of subjects from both groups, and the number
is determined by the maximally available number of subjects from the smaller group.
For example, in the age interval 60 to 65, there are 19 subjects in the HC group and 
36 subjects in the dementia group, and we used all 19 subjects in the HC group and sampled
19 subjects from the dementia group. To produce the reported result, there are 228 subjects
sampled in each group.

The preprocessing pipeline uses fsl_anat command from FSL42 for automatic bias field removal,
12 degree of freedom linear registration, non-linear registration to a standard space 
(2mm MNI 152 space), and 1mm brain extraction. Finally, the 1mm brain is linearly transformed
to MNI 152 (with flirt command) and used for the subsequent CNN training/validation/testing. 
The preprocessing is largely automatic and can be considered as minimal comparing to complex
feature extraction techniques for traditional machine learning methods.
